* minor fix:
** exclude certain modes/buffers from evil mode
  - dired
  - rinari console
* investigate
  escreen
  elscreen (or other)
  deft.el -- like notational velocity
* install
  http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/TransposeFrame
* fix:
- function that inserts vertical space between def/ends and also contexts/shoulds/tests but only when needed

* get working:
learn about eshell
bookmarks, bookmarks+

* coding projects:
  pr/find-alternate-file
  pr/find-related-file
  pr/last-migration
  pr/previous-migration
  pr/next-migration
  pr/find-model
  etc
** evil text objexts mostly:
  - ruby block
  - ruby method
  - argument
  - function/method
  - add space above/below line
  - fix comment/uncomment region (turn into text oject)
  - get working versions of ,gm etc (go to model)
  - word boundary includes '_' -- maybe includes all symbol chars
  - complete history across files (forwad/back)
* packages that should be written
package to allow the use of snipmate snippets AS IS
package that fully emmulates rails.vim maybe in pieces
(part of emacs.rails)
rails.vim.emacs
rails-navigation
	controllers, models, views, etc, plus last migration
projectile-rails?
factory girl compleitions type name of factory then hit key and get either build or create
make perspective.el persist projects -- duh
persp mode does not automatically track buffers -- wtf


list of projects and files so that you can switch to a project and be in it


run test that puts compilation window small and on bottom right or bottom left as per config
run test that runs last test if not in a test buffer

gem browser

* remarkably cool things:
- both query/replace styles
- vim version does it inline
- window history
- vim "emulation" but extensible like vim
- calling emacs elisp functions from eshell
* failed (for now)
- sessions (desktop is great, winner is great, workgroups sucks, perspectives aren't persistant -- wtf)
- see if persp can be made to work
* learned:
c-x, c-j  - dired-jump -- awesome jump from file to dired with file selected
